C# and C#.NET are the same thing... C#
.NET is, as you say, a library of code that .NET languages can talk to.
.NET languages come in different flavours such as: C#.NET, VB.NET, Managed C++, F#.
.NET languages compile to CIL (Common Intermediate Language) which means they all start 
"talking" the same language and can therefore interoperate.
ASP.NET is the portion of the .NET library used for making web sites. There are other subsections of ASP.NET like WebForms
(the old way of making web pages) or the rapidly maturing MVC library that are worth looking at too.
Forms (old tech) or the new WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) are the technologies you'd typically use in
.NET to create what you know as traditional desktop applications.
