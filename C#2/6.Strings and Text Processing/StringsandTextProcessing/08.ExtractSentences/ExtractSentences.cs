    8. Extract sentences

   Write a program that extracts from a given text all sentences containing 
   given word.

       Example:
        
       The word is: in
        
       The text is: We are living in a yellow submarine. We don't have anything 
       else. Inside the submarine is very tight. So we are drinking all the day. 
       We will move out of it in 5 days.
        
       The expected result is: We are living in a yellow submarine. We will move 
       out of it in 5 days.
        
       Consider that the sentences are separated by . and the words – by 
       non-letter symbols.
